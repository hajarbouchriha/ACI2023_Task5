# Security Policy Review and Development

This repository provides a framework for reviewing existing security policies and procedures, proposing updates, and developing new policies based on industry best practices and compliance requirements. The goal is to ensure that policies cover critical areas such as acceptable use, password management, and data protection.

## Overview

In many organizations, regular review and development of security policies are essential to maintain a robust security posture. This project aims to facilitate the process by providing a Python-based tool for managing security policies.

## Features

- **Review Existing Policies:**
  - The `review_existing_policies` method allows for a detailed review of existing security policies, providing information on each policy and checking for compliance with industry standards.

- **Propose Updates or Develop New Policies:**
  - The `propose_update_or_add_policy` and `develop_new_policy` methods serve as placeholders for implementing logic to propose updates or develop entirely new policies based on specific criteria.

- **Ensure Comprehensive Coverage:**
  - The compliance checks (`is_compliant_with_acceptable_use`, `is_compliant_with_password_management`, and `is_compliant_with_data_protection`) ensure that policies cover critical areas such as acceptable use, password management, and data protection.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
